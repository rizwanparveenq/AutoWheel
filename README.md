# AutoWheel
CPS Modeling for health related scenarios: Model-based approach to design the wheelchair based monitoring system.
AutoWheel.xml file is a Ptolemy-II file, which has to be opened in Ptolemy-II latest version. Run the simulation using the play button given on top menu. This simulation shows the trajectory creation. You can open each actor and see the implementation of the each component and their working. Sampling rate, timings etc can also changed easily by changing the constant parameters values. sates of path creation is modelled in 'Path Computation' actor. You can also animate the execution via debug option, to see how each component is working and when.

Automove.xml is UPPAAL simulation file, which has to be opened in UPPAAL 4.1.19 version. More scenarios will be uploaded soon where individual component is modeled and states verification done.
